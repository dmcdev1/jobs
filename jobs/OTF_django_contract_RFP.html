# Overview

The Open Technology Fund (OTF) seeks one to three individuals or organizations to create a Django application as a replacement for our existing Drupal application managing the requests for support (submissions) we receive. This will also entail deploying a Django-based CMS to maintain our existing public-facing website at opentech.fund. 

# Background

OTF currently maintains a website built on Drupal 7 with a mix of contributed and custom modules. It serves two purposes. First, it maintains the public facing website providing informational pages, news, funded projects, the team and advisory council members. Second, the website is a complex customized application managing all aspects of our proposal submission and review workflows. Despite Drupal having served OTF well since 2012, after an assessment of our current and future demands and customizations required, we have determined to migrate to a Django application with feature parity of our existing application. 

# Specific areas of work to include: 

* Work with OTF to finalize the system architecture, implementation, and migration details;
* Design and create a central application providing an authenticated management API;
* Deploy a Django-based CMS to maintain our existing public facing website at opentech.fund;
* Conduct a full re-design of the web-based interface for submission management;
* Create an interface to the management API for user interaction via Slack, Signal, and email;
* Perform content migration between the existing and new applications;
* Create the initial full developer and user documentation; and,
* Conduct any needed trainings.

# Contract and Application Details 

Acceptable applications will be for no less than $5,000 USD and for no more than $150,000 USD, must include the number of hours of work being provided, and the hourly rate per offered service.

Applications are due by 15-Jul-2017.
